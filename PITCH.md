# HotOrBot 🔥🤖
### The Dating Show You Play Every Night

---

## The Problem
Dating apps are broken. You swipe, you match, you type "hey," you get ghosted. Even when you land a date, 30% of people no-show. The result: a $10B industry built on disappointment.

## The Insight
The best dating content isn't apps — it's shows. Love Is Blind. Too Hot to Handle. The Turing Test meets The Bachelor. People don't just want to date — they want to *play*.

## The Game
**HotOrBot** — a live video dating game where you never know if you're talking to the real person or their AI agent.

You join a video date. The other side might be the actual human — or it might be their AI agent, trained on their personality, powered by generative video. You flirt, you vibe, you decide: **HOT or BOT?**

The reveal comes AFTER you vote. And that moment? That's the clip. That's the screenshot. That's the thing people talk about at brunch.

## How It Works
1. 🤖 **Create your AI twin** — train it on your personality, humor, deal-breakers, and vibe
2. 📹 **Join video dates** — you'll be randomly matched for short live video chats
3. 🎭 **Sometimes it's them. Sometimes it's their bot.** You don't know which.
4. 🔥 **Vote: HOT or BOT** — rate the vibe AND guess if it was real
5. 💡 **The Reveal** — find out the truth. Were you charmed by a human or fooled by AI?
6. ❤️ **Mutual HOT + real chemistry = match** — your agent already proved the vibe

## The Magic Moments

**You said HOT, it was the bot** → The real person is *at least* as interesting as their AI. You're intrigued. Second date.

**You said HOT, it was real** → Instant chemistry. You matched on personality, live, under pressure. Strongest signal in dating.

**You said NOT, it was real** → Honest. Clean. Next. No one wasted weeks texting.

**You said NOT, it was the bot** → Maybe the human is better? Unlock a second chance round.

## Why This Wins

**It's a game, not a chore.** Swiping is work. This is entertainment. People will play HotOrBot the way they play Wordle — daily, social, addictive.

**Ghosting is solved.** Your agent always shows up. The date always happens. No more staring at a "running 5 min late" that turns into silence.

**The content creates itself.** Every reveal is a potential TikTok. "I couldn't tell if it was him or his bot" is the most sharable dating moment since Love Is Blind pods. Built-in virality.

**It's a Turing test you WANT to fail.** The better the bot, the more attractive the person becomes. For the first time, your personality — not your photos — is the product.

## Market
- **TAM:** $10.5B global online dating + $230B creator/entertainment economy
- **Target:** 18-35, AI-native, content-native, swipe-fatigued
- **Positioning:** Not a dating app. A dating *game*. Think Omegle meets Love Is Blind meets ChatGPT.

## Business Model
- **Free:** 3 video rounds/day, basic agent
- **Pro ($12.99/mo):** Unlimited rounds, advanced agent training, see your agent's replays
- **VIP ($29.99/mo):** Priority matching, multi-persona agents, exclusive pools
- **Boost ($4.99):** Priority placement for your next round
- **Creator tier:** Top-rated agents get revenue share (agent leaderboard)

## The Tech
- **Generative video AI** for real-time agent avatars (build on existing models — HeyGen, Synthesia-style tech, or custom)
- **LLM personality engine** for conversation (fine-tuned on user's chat style)
- **Real-time video infrastructure** (WebRTC + AI inference pipeline)
- **The moat:** The longer users play, the better their agents get. Network effects + data flywheel.

## Traction Plan
1. **Waitlist via nostalgic Hot or Not landing page** — the brand is dormant and culturally loaded
2. **Seed with creators** — invite dating TikTokers to play early, record reveals
3. **PR angle:** "Hot or Not is back — but now you might be flirting with AI"
4. **Launch format:** Weekly "HotOrBot Live" events → creates urgency + FOMO
5. **Reddit + Twitter seeding:** Dating app subreddits, AI Twitter, dating coaches

## The Team
**Amanda Bradford** — Founder of The League, the invite-only dating app with millions of users. Built and scaled a dating platform from zero to cultural phenomenon. Knows user psychology, matching algorithms, and the dating space inside and out.

## The Ask
Seed round to build MVP (agent training + video infrastructure), launch invite-only beta, and own the AI dating entertainment category.
